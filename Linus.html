            <h2>About Linus Torvalds</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Linus Torvalds: A Biography</h3>
            Linus Benedict Torvalds, born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland, is a Finnish-American computer
            scientist best known for creating the Linux kernel, a core component of the GNU/Linux operating system.
            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            From a young age, Linus showed an interest in programming, inspired by his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20.
            He pursued his studies at the University of Helsinki, where he earned a master's degree in computer science
            in 1996. His thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.
            <h3>Creation of Linux</h3>
            In 1991, dissatisfied with the MS-DOS operating system on his personal computer, Torvalds decided to develop
            an alternative inspired by UNIX. Using Maurice J. Bach's book The Design of the Unix Operating System as a
            guide, he created a kernel that he named "Linux," combining his first name with UNIX. He released this
            kernel under the GPLv2 license, allowing anyone to modify and improve the source code.
            <h3>Professional Career</h3>
            After university, Torvalds worked at Transmeta in the United States from 1997 to 2003, where he contributed
            to the design of the Crusoe processor. In 2003, he dedicated himself entirely to Linux kernel development
            within the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), which later merged with The Free Standards Group to become
            the Linux Foundation.
            <h3>Contributions and Honors</h3>
            In addition to Linux, Torvalds also created Git, a widely used distributed version control system. He has
            received numerous accolades for his contributions to computing, including the Millennium Technology Prize in
            2012 and the Computer Pioneer Award in 2014. Torvalds is known for his strict oversight of Linux kernel
            development, earning him the nickname "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL) of the Linux project. Today, he
            remains a central figure in open-source development and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010.
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            Linus Torvaldsâ€™ work has had a profound impact on software development and open-source communities
            worldwide. His vision and commitment to collaboration continue to inspire developers and tech enthusiasts
            around the globe.
