            <h2>About Linus Torvalds</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Linus Torvalds: A Biography</h3>
            Linus Benedict Torvalds, born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland, is a Finnish-American computer
            scientist best known for creating the Linux kernel, a core component of the GNU/Linux operating system.
            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            From a young age, Linus showed an interest in programming, inspired by his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20.
            He pursued his studies at the University of Helsinki, where he earned a master's degree in computer science
            in 1996. His thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.
            <h3>Creation of Linux</h3>
            In 1991, dissatisfied with the MS-DOS operating system on his personal computer, Torvalds decided to develop
            an alternative inspired by UNIX. Using Maurice J. Bach's book The Design of the Unix Operating System as a
            guide, he created a kernel that he named "Linux," combining his first name with UNIX. He released this
            kernel under the GPLv2 license, allowing anyone to modify and improve the source code.
            <h3>Creation of Git</h3>
            In 2005, Linus Torvalds created Git, a distributed version control system, to manage the development of the
            Linux kernel. Git was designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
            efficiency.
            It has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, known for its
            robustness,
            flexibility, and distributed nature. Git's creation was driven by the need for a reliable and efficient
            system
            to manage the growing complexity of the Linux kernel development.
            <h3>Professional Career</h3>
            After university, Torvalds worked at Transmeta in the United States from 1997 to 2003, where he contributed
            to the design of the Crusoe processor. In 2003, he dedicated himself entirely to Linux kernel development
            within the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), which later merged with The Free Standards Group to become
            the Linux Foundation.
            <h3>Contributions and Honors</h3>
            In addition to Linux, Torvalds also created Git, a widely used distributed version control system. He has
            received numerous accolades for his contributions to computing, including the Millennium Technology Prize in
            2012 and the Computer Pioneer Award in 2014. Torvalds is known for his strict oversight of Linux kernel
            development, earning him the nickname "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL) of the Linux project. Today, he
            remains a central figure in open-source development and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010.
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            Linus Torvalds’ work has had a profound impact on software development and open-source communities
            worldwide. His vision and commitment to collaboration continue to inspire developers and tech enthusiasts
            around the globe.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>He created Linux because he didn’t have money for UNIX</h3>
        In early 1991, unhappy with MS-DOS and MINIX, Torvalds wanted to buy a UNIX system. Luckily for us, he didn’t
        have enough money. So he decided to make his own clone of UNIX, from scratch
        <h3> Linux could have been called Freax</h3>
        In September 1991, Linus announced Linux (standing for ‘Linus’s MINIX’) and encouraged his colleagues to use its
        source code for wider distribution.

        Linus thought that the name Linux was too egotistical. He wanted to change it to Freax (based on free, freak and
        MINIX), but his friend Lemmarke had already created a directory called Linux on his FTP server. And thus the
        name Linux continued.
        <h3>Steve Jobs wanted him to work on Apple’s macOS</h3>
        In 2000, Apple’s founder Steve Jobs invited him to work on Apple’s macOS. Linus refused the lucrative offer and
        continued to work on the Linux kernel.
        <h3>Linus has an asteroid named after him</h3>
        He has numerous awards to his name, including an asteroid named 9793 Torvalds.</p>
